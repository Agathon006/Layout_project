# My first project, just to get in Frontend using html, scss, js, 

---

Created a website layout using HTML, SCSS, and basic JavaScript, based on a design mockup from Figma (https://www.figma.com/file/1A1SJ7FYyMUiBqhU3WUiBI/Portfolio?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design). The layout faithfully follows the design specifications provided in the Figma mockup and is styled using SCSS to achieve the desired visual appearance. Basic JavaScript is incorporated for implementing interactive elements and functionality. This project demonstrates proficiency in front-end web development, showcasing the ability to translate a design mockup into a fully functioning website using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.
